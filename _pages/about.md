I am finishing my PhD under the supervision of Professor Markus Kraft in the [Computaional Modelling Group](www.como.ceb.cam.ac.uk) in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechology at the Univesrity of Cambridge. 
I modelleted the synthesis of titania dioxide nanoparticles in flames using computational fluid dynamic tools built off of [OpenFOAM](www.openfoam.org) and the kinetcis API developed by [CMCL Innovations](www.cmclinnovations.com).  

I am actively seeking new and exciting opportunities to collaborate with a new team to tackle technical challenges and gain project management experience.
