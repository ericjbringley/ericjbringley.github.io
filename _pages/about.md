I am finishing my PhD under the supervision of Professor Markus Kraft in the [Computaional Modelling Group](www.como.ceb.cam.ac.uk) in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechology at the Univesrity of Cambridge. 
I modelleted the synthesis of titania dioxide nanoparticles in flames using computational fluid dynamic tools built off of [OpenFOAM](www.openfoam.org) and the kinetcis API developed by [CMCL Innovations](www.cmclinnovations.com).  

Beyond the office, I am an Explorer Leader with the Newnham 11th/9th Explorer Scout Unit, have recently comopleted my [Wood Badge](https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/learning-development-and-awards/awards-and-recognition/wood-badge/), and working to become a Duke of Edinburgh (DofE) leader. I am also working to learn Mandarin and intend to take the HSK qualifications.

I am actively seeking new and exciting opportunities to collaborate with a new team to tackle technical challenges and gain project management experience.
