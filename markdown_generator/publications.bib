  abstract = {New experimental 2D measurements are reported to characterise the flame location, shape and temperature of laminar premixed ethylene jet-wall stagnation flames when the equivalence ratio, exit gas velocity and burner-plate separation distance are varied. Bandpass-filtered optical measurements of the CH* chemiluminescence were used to provide information about the shape and location of the flames. Thin filament pyrometry (TFP) using a 14 \textmu m diameter SiC filament was used to make line measurements of the temperature to reconstruct the full 2D temperature field for the first time in premixed, jet-wall stagnation flames. The comparison of CH* measurements with (intrusive) and without (non-intrusive) the presence of the SiC filament showed that the filament resulted in minimal disturbance of the flame when the filament was placed downstream of the flame front. However, the flame was observed to attach to the filament, resulting in more significant disturbance, when it was placed upstream of the flame front. The flames were simulated using both 1D and 2D models. The 2D simulations were used to provide estimates of the velocity, kinematic viscosity and thermal conductivity required to calculate the gas temperature from the TFP data. The 1D simulations showed excellent agreement with the experimentally observed centreline quantities, but required the strain boundary condition to be fitted in order to match the experimentally observed flame location. The 2D simulations showed excellent agreement without the need for any fitting, and correctly predicted the flame shape, location and temperature as the experimental conditions were varied. A comparison of the set of simulated temperature-residence times along different streamlines showed relatively uniform distributions within each flame. However, the most uniform set of temperature-residence time distributions did not correlate with the flattest flame.},

  abstract = {Audio recordings are a significant component of the world's modern cultural history and are retained for future generations in libraries, archives, and museums. The vast majority of tapes contain polyester-urethane as the magnetic particle binder, the degradation of which threatens the playability and integrity of these often unique recordings. Magnetic tapes with stored historical data are degrading and need to be identified prior to digitization and/or preservation. We demonstrate the successful differentiation of playable and nonplayable quarter-inch audio tapes, allowing the minimally invasive triage of tape collections. Without such a method, recordings are put at risk during playback, which is the current method for identifying degraded tapes. A total of 133 quarter-inch audio tapes were analyzed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR). Classification of IR spectra in regards to tape playability was accomplished using principal component analysis (PCA) followed by quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and K-means cluster analysis. The first principal component suggests intensities at the following wavenumbers to be representative of nonplayable tapes: 1730 cm\textendash 1, 1700 cm\textendash 1, 1255 cm\textendash 1, and 1140 cm\textendash 1. QDA and cluster analysis both successfully identified 93.78\% of nonplayable tapes in the calibration set and 92.31\% of nonplayable tapes in the test set. This application of IR spectra assessed with multivariate statistical analysis offers a path to greatly improve efficiency of audio tape preservation. This rapid, minimally invasive technique shows potential to replace the manual playback test, a potentially destructive technique, ultimately allowing the safe preservation of culturally valuable content.},

Three other TiO               2               polymorphs, namely anatase, rutile and TiO               2               -B phases, can also be obtained by tuning the oxygen/fuel ratio. TiO               2               -II is observed as a mixture with rutile under oxygen-lean flame conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this phase has been identified in flame-synthesised TiO               2               . The formation of TiO               2               -II in an atmospheric pressure flame cannot be explained thermodynamically and is hypothesised to be kinetically driven through the oxidation and solid-state transformation of a sub-oxide TiO               2-x               intermediate. In this scenario, rutile is nucleated from the metastable TiO               2               -II phase instead of directly from a molten/amorphous state. Mixtures containing three-phase heterojunctions of anatase, rutile, and TiO               2               -II nanoparticles as prepared here in slightly oxygen-lean flames might be important in photocatalysis due to enhanced electron\textendash hole separation.},

  abstract = {In this work, a framework for modelling twin-screw granulation processes with variable screw configurations using a high-dimensional stochastic population balance method is presented. A modular compartmental approach is presented and a method for estimating residence times for model compartments based on screw element geometry is introduced. The model includes particle mechanisms for nucleation, primary particle layering, coalescence, breakage, and consolidation. A new twin-screw breakage model is introduced, which takes into account the differing breakage dynamics between two types of screw element. Additionally, a new sub-model for the layering of primary particles onto larger agglomerates is presented. The resulting model is used to simulate a twin-screw system with a number of different screw configurations and the predictive power of the model is assessed through comparison with an existing experimental data set in the literature. For most of the screw configurations simulated, the model predicts the product particle size distribution at large particle sizes with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, the model has a tendency to over-predict the amount of fines in the final product. Nevertheless, the model qualitatively captures the reduction in fines associated with an increase in the number of kneading elements, as observed experimentally. Based on model results, a number of key areas for future model development are identified and discussed.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work is to conduct a parametric study on the design variables and flow distribution of a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR). The numerical solutions were obtained by using Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) technique. Three different designs of CSTR with Napier grass as substance were evaluated for mixing efficiency, vorticity, and flow behavior, Model 1: one propeller no baffle tank, Model 2: one propeller with baffles tank, and Model 3: double propellers with baffles tank. The results show that the fluid velocity and the direction of fluid motion play the major role on the mixing characteristic. The propellers, baffles plates, and stirring speeds are significant factors on the fluid direction and thus the mixing performance. The solid\textendash liquid mixing efficiency can be calculated from the numerical results of Discrete Phase Model (DPM) by image analysis technique. The mixing efficiency of Models 1, 2, and 3 are 10.08\%, 23.77\% and 34.66\%, respectively. The power numbers which indicate the power consumption of the system of Models 1, 2, and 3 are 0.91, 1.20 and 2.00, respectively. Therefore, Model 3 gives the best mixing efficiency but requires higher energy consumption. This work also characterized the mixing quality in various depth levels. The predictions implement along with the mixing efficiency in order to evaluate mixing efficiency of the system completely.},

The main goals of this study are to (1) create a working model to quantitatively understand particle mixing, (2) characterize and compare contra-rotating single shaft impellers to single shaft co-rotating dual impellers, (3) improve quantification of particle mixing through image processing for both computational and experimental techniques, and (4) make design decisions with the computational analysis. Twelve cases were studied by changing the direction of impeller rotation, impeller pumping direction, and the presence of baffles. Particles with specific gravities (SG) of 0.866 and 1.050 were introduced into the experimental and computational systems in a finite and countable number. The numerical solution was obtained using the Lattice Boltzmann method and the Discrete Particle method. A commercial LBM solver, XFlow, was used for the simulation. The input torques and mixing efficiency with various flow configurations and specific gravities was used to find an optimal design. For the mixing of the lighter particles, the contra configuration with inward opposing flow gave optimal performance of highest mixing efficiency at lowest required torque. Co-rotating impellers with baffles gave the best performance of high mixing efficiency at lowest power input for the heavier particles.},
